# Desktop Environment

My [daily driver](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/sabrehagen/desktop-environment).

## Getting Started

On a clean install of Ubuntu 18.10+ run as `root`:

```sh
# Clone desktop environment
git clone https://github.com/sabrehagen/desktop-environment

# Start desktop environment
desktop-environment/scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

## Forking

Set your [user configuration](scripts/environment.sh#L3) and go.
